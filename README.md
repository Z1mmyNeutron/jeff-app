## This is something I wrote for Jeff Lubindar in React.js

I used a grid system to establish complete control over the layout of the screen; I used a switch router to navigate to different pages while keeping the nav bar in the header, and I manipulated the background in photoshop as well as in the grid system to establish the template he wanted. 

This project was interesting, the getQuote page has been the most challenging so far as there has to be an arrowhead function that uses boolean logic in a while loop to establish when the form page will be submitted. This part is still a work in progress as it is the last page.
